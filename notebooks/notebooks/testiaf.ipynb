        "Second the function ``build_network`` is defined to build the network and\nreturn the handles of the ``spike_recorder`` and the ``voltmeter``. The\nfunction takes the simulation resolution as argument\n\nThe function first resets the simulation kernel and sets the number of\nthreads and the simulation resolution.  The ``iaf_psc_alpha`` neuron is\ncreated and the handle is stored in the variable `neuron`. The status of\nthe neuron is changed so it receives an external current. Next a\n``voltmeter`` and a ``spike_recorder`` are created and their handles stored\nin the variables `vm` and `sr` respectively.\n\nThe voltmeter and spike recorder are then connected to the neuron. ``Connect``\ntakes the device and neuron handles as input. The voltmeter is connected to the\nneuron and the neuron to the spike recorder because the neuron sends spikes\nto the recorder and the voltmeter 'observes' the neuron.\n\n"
