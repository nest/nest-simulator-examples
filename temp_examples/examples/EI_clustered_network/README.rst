EI-clustered circuit model
==========================

This is PyNEST implementation of the EI-clustered circuit model described by Rostami et al. [1]_.

   :alt: EI-clustered circuit model.

   Schematic of the EI-clustered circuit model. The network consists of `n_clusters` with one excitatory and one inhibitory population each.

Citing this code
----------------

If you use this code, we ask you to cite the paper by Rostami et al. [1]_ and the NEST release on Zenodo.

File structure
--------------

* :doc:`run_simulation.py <run_simulation>`: an example script to try out the EI-clustered circuit model
* :doc:`network.py <network>`: the main ``Network`` class with functions to build and simulate the network
* :doc:`helper.py <helper>`: helper functions for calculation of synaptic weights and currents and plot function for raster plots
* :doc:`network_params.py <network_params>`: network and neuron parameters
* :doc:`stimulus_params.py <stimulus_params>`: parameters for optional external stimulation
* :doc:`sim_params.py <sim_params>`: simulation parameters

Running the simulation
----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   python run_simulation_EI.py

A raster plot of the network activity is saved as ``clustered_ei_raster.png``.

The code can be parallelized by using multiple threads during the NEST simulation.
This can be done by setting the parameter ``n_vp`` in the ``run_simulation_EI.py`` script.
