    "----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "The class SudokuNet constructs a network of LIF neurons with static synapses\n",
    "that due to their connectivity rules can converge on valid solutions for Sudoku.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes\n",
    "~~~~~\n",
    "The functionality of the network lies entirely within the inhibitory\n",
    "connections between neuron populations. Each population of size ``n_digit``\n",
    "encodes a digit between 1 and 9 in one of the 81 cells and has outgoing\n",
    "inhibitory connections to several other populations. Namely all populations\n",
    "coding for the same digit in the same row, column and 3x3 box of the sudoku\n",
    "field, since a given digit can only ever occur once in any of those three. It\n",
    "also inhibits all populations in the same cell which encode different digits\n",
    "to force the network to converge on a single digit per cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the network is simulated with just this configuration and some background\n",
    "noise, it converges naturally on states that represent valid solutions for\n",
    "Sudoku.\n",
    "\n",
    "If populations coding for specific digits in some of the cells are stimulated\n",
    "externally (therefore inhibiting all other digits in the same cell), the\n",
    "network usually converges on a solution compatible with the input\n",
    "configuration, thus solving the puzzle.\n",
